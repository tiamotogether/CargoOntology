# CargoOntology
Specialized ontology based on One Record.  
The One Record standard(https://github.com/IATA-Cargo/ONE-Record), developed by the International Aviation Association (IATA), is an end-to-end digital logistics and transport data model that allows data to be easily and transparently exchanged throughout the entire flow of air transport.  However, its standard only defines the core concepts. 
In the concrete application of knowledge graph, it is necessary to refine the definition of knowledge ontology and carry out application development.
